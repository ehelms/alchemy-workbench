== Converge-UI Example

This is a simple rails application that is used to show off how to not only incorporate converge-ui but as a simple test bed for viewing styles and layouts.  This repository can be used for demo purposes or with some tweaks to the git configuration, as a development environment for converge-ui.

== Getting Started

When cloning converge-ui-example, the simplest method is to use the --recursive flag:

  git clone --recursive  http://github.com/Katello/converge-ui-example.git

If you have already cloned the repository without the --recursive flag, running the following to take care of submodule setup:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update
